# SHOPEASE-PROJECT
<h1 align="center" id="title">SHOPEASE PROJECT</h1>

<p id="description">For this project I obtained a sales dataset to use for the project. I fed the data into 5 tables using psql. I then created routes for all the tables and implemented GET, PUT, POST and DELETE for each route. I then used swaggerJs to create API documentation for all the endpoints. I made use of stored procedures and to be able to calculate aggregate functions such as total sales. Furthemore, I implemented triggers which track timestamps for which when a product or an order is updated.</p>
